    <h3>Amphibians</h3>
    Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of
    habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as
    larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva
    with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial
    salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds,
    reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are
    often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.
    
    The earliest amphibians evolved in the Devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in
    adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and
    other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.
    
    The three modern orders of amphibians are Anura (the frogs and toads), Urodela (the salamanders), and Apoda (the caecilians). The number of known
    amphibian species is approximately 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from New
    Guinea (Paedophryne amauensis) with a length of just 7.7 mm (0.30 in). The largest living amphibian is the 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) Chinese giant
    salamander (Andrias davidianus), but this is dwarfed by the extinct 9 m (30 ft) Prionosuchus from the middle Permian of Brazil. The study of
    amphibians is called batrachology, while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology.
    
    <h4>Classification</h4>
    The word "amphibian" is derived from the Ancient Greek term ἀμφίβιος (amphíbios), which means "both kinds of life", ἀμφί meaning "of both kinds" and
    βιος meaning "life". The term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water, including seals and
    otters.[2] Traditionally, the class Amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes. Amphibia in its widest sense (sensu lato) was
    divided into three subclasses, two of which are extinct:[3]
    
    Subclass Lepospondyli† (small Paleozoic group, which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than Lissamphibia)
    Subclass Temnospondyli† (diverse Paleozoic and early Mesozoic grade)
    Subclass Lissamphibia (all modern amphibians, including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts and caecilians)
    Salientia (frogs, toads and relatives): Jurassic to present—6,200 current species in 53 families
    Caudata (salamanders, newts and relatives): Jurassic to present—652 current species in 9 families
    Gymnophiona (caecilians and relatives): Jurassic to present—192 current species in 10 families
    Triadobatrachus massinoti
    Triadobatrachus massinoti, a proto-frog from the Early Triassic of Madagascar
    The actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed. The two most common systems are the classification
    adopted by the website AmphibiaWeb, University of California, Berkeley and the classification by herpetologist Darrel Frost and the American Museum
    of Natural History, available as the online reference database "Amphibian Species of the World".[4] The numbers of species cited above follows Frost
    and the total number of known amphibian species is over 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs.[5]
    
    With the phylogenetic classification, the taxon Labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining
    features apart from shared primitive characteristics. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use
    a stem-based or a node-based classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group
    that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia.
    The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally
    placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of phylogenetic
    nomenclature have removed a large number of basal Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in
    Linnaean taxonomy, and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy.[1] If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in
    Amphibia, it becomes a paraphyletic group.[6]
    
    All modern amphibians are included in the subclass Lissamphibia, which is usually considered a clade, a group of species that have evolved from a
    common ancestor. The three modern orders are Anura (the frogs and toads), Caudata (or Urodela, the salamanders), and Gymnophiona (or Apoda, the
    caecilians).[7] It has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a Temnospondyl-like ancestor, and even that caecilians are the sister
    group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians, and thus of amniotes.[8] Although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with primitive
    characteristics are known, the oldest "true frog" is Prosalirus bitis, from the Early Jurassic Kayenta Formation of Arizona. It is anatomically very
    similar to modern frogs.[9] The oldest known caecilian is another Early Jurassic species, Eocaecilia micropodia, also from Arizona.[10] The earliest
    salamander is Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the Late Jurassic of northeastern China.[11]
    
    Authorities disagree as to whether Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia.
    The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders, but an extinct salamander-like family, the Albanerpetontidae, is now considered part
    of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog,
    Triadobatrachus.[12]
    
    <h4>Evolutionary history</h4>
    The first major groups of amphibians developed in the Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the
    modern coelacanth and lungfish.[13] These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl
    along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in
    oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their
    bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
    Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to
    develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.[14]
    
    Many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered. Ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils
    and more efficient lungs. It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish,
    Eusthenopteron.[13] Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods. Their lungs improved and their
    skeletons became heavier and stronger, better able to support the weight of their bodies on land. They developed "hands" and "feet" with five or
    more digits;[15] the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation.[14] The fish's hyomandibula bone in the hyoid
    region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear, an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land.[16] An
    affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi-folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra-occipital bones at the back of
    the head, neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom.[17]
    
    Diplocaulus
    The Permian lepospondyl Diplocaulus was largely aquatic
    At the end of the Devonian period (360 million years ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early
    plants and devoid of vertebrates,[17] though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they
    may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal.[15] In the
    early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and
    calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the
    terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain, occupying the ecological
    position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong
    tail.[17] They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many
    types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic
    larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out,
    that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.[13]
    
    After the Carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles,[18] and amphibians were further devastated by the
    Permian–Triassic extinction event.[19] During the Triassic Period (250 to 200 million years ago), the reptiles continued to out-compete the
    amphibians, leading to a reduction in both the amphibians' size and their importance in the biosphere. According to the fossil record, Lissamphibia,
    which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli
    at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Triassic. The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating,[14] but the
    most recent molecular study, based on multilocus sequence typing, suggests a Late Carboniferous/Early Permian origin for extant amphibians.[20]
    
    Eryops
    The temnospondyl Eryops had sturdy limbs to support its body on land
    The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on
    rDNA analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the
    divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the
    supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which
    radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.[21] There are large gaps in the fossil record,
    but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs.
    Molecular analysis suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates.[8]
    Newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all Lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that stereospondyls are the closest
    relatives to the caecilians.[22]
    
    As they evolved from lunged fish, amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land, including the need to develop new means of
    locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required.
    Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding.
    Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed
    to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for
    reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The
    skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.[23]
